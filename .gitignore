I selected Render as the hosting platform for deploying the Flask application. Render provides an easy and reliable environment for Python web apps, supports automatic deployments through GitHub integration, and offers a free tier suitable for student or small-scale projects.
Additional reasons for choosing Render include:

No credit card required for deployment

Automatic build and deploy on every Git push

Built-in logging and service monitoring

Straightforward configuration using a Procfile and requirements.txt
